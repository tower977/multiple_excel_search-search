# multiple_excel_search-search

This simple excel automation script aims to reduce human error, automate the excel search task, and to carry out the task without disruption of the data by importing the data into a separate dataframe.


The beauty of this script is that it can be made user responsive with the inclusion of the system arguments built in functions.

For this specific purpose it is unnecessary for now and may be built in at a later date, task depending.

Two basic excel files have been added for trial.
